# Ges 486 Final Project

## Objectives

For this project, my aim was to represent health inequalities through a geospatial perspective. By using spatial statistics, as well as a series of stylistic maps, I wanted to crreate an analysis oflife expectancy and healthcare availability that was both analytical and approachable. In the United States, is there a relationship between the two?

## Methods and Data

To begin my analysis, I thought it would be appropriate to start on the state level. The first map I made was a series of simple cartograms with iterations varying from 1-7. In this map, the most bloated regions are those with the highest sq mile/ hospital ratio (furthest expected distance to travel to reciieve medical attention). This map also shows average life expectancy by state, with red being the lowest, and blue being the highest.

Next, I chose  to create a chloropleth map of life expectancy in the United States, with blues and greens being the highest life expectancy, and oranges and reds being the lowest.

Next, I chose to create a cloropleth of hospitals normalized to population. This would show what communities were being underserved as a relation of population density, rather than geographic distance.

I was also aware that often times people travel beyond county and state boundries to recieve healthcare, so I created a simple hex map with 150 mile cells showing hospital distribution in the lower 48 states.
